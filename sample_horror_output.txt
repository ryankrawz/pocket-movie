THE BIG SCARE

by: Random Guy





-- Fade in from black --


It was a dark and stormy night.

                         RESUME
               It's a human toe. Frightened,   
     he's wielding a SCISSORS, poised to strike. 

JEFF is tattered and smeared with vermillion ink.

 
THE DOCTOR:
	"Single someone out"

 

MEGAN:
	"Okay?"

 

JEFF sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes.


VICTOR:
	"Stop that!"
                                    
               Trying to follow, he COLLIDES With some furniture. Nothing
               moves...and then...

               WHAM! A broken lamp lies
               SMASHED on its side. Because that's where 
                   their bones are! 

JEFF:
	"Why is he stalling on this?"

 

MEGAN:
	"Make a difference, does it?"

 

ELIZABETH:
	"Call!"

 

THE DOCTOR:
	"Why did I agree to this?"

 GATTLING GUNS protrude from    
     a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT.

ELIZABETH:
	"Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off"

    SHAKE MORE VIOLENTLY NOW... and that creates a
sound.

THE DOCTOR:
	"Now, what were we last speaking of...?"

 He moves towards it and as he does
          it OPENS. 

JEFF:
	"Is quiet, isn't it?"

 THEN:
                         
          WHAM! 

VICTOR:
	"And what if I run into one"

 

ELIZABETH:
	"What!"

 

JEFF:
	"What is this place?"
 
                    Lots of
               BUBBLING and GURGLING -- THEN SOMETHING LUNGES OUT! CHARGES
               FORWARD. RUSTLING
          EERILY.
