	FADE IN:

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY

	CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

	YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

				P.A. SYSTEM
		Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.

	INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT

				PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
		--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

	COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.

	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
	FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
	ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
	"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
	"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.

	Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.

	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...

				COLE
		Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

	JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!

				JOSE
		"Volunteers" again.

	JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.

				SCARFACE
		"Volunteer duty".

    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

				COLE
		I didn't volunteer.

				SCARFACE
		You causing trouble again?

				COLE
			(controls his temper)
		No trouble.
