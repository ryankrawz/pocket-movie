               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT

               Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and 
               cacophony of a major seaport.

               We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the 
               GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries 
               it onto a ship.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches 
               the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew 
               but he's a born leader.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering 
               the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop.

                                     LYLE
                         I've got the orbital data and SV 
                         clock corrections for each satellite 
                         that gets the signal. That'll make 
                         my reading as solid as the Precise 
                         Positioning Service that only the 
                         D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 
                         meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter 
                         vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds 
                         time accuracy.

               SWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant 
               confidence mixed with the hint of a smile.

                                     STEVE
                         Why can't he talk like a person?

                                     CHARLIE
                         ...Because he's not.

                                     LYLE
                         I do need one more thing, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's that?

                                     LYLE
                         Someone to turn the goddamn homing 
                         device on. No signal, no score.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Steve)
                         Where're the Italians?

                                     STEVE
                         Patience.
