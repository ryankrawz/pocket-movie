          Based on the May 2007 "Wired" magazine article
          entitled "The Great Escape" by Joshuah Bearman;
          and chapter nine of the book entitled
          "The Master of Disguise" by Antonio Mendez.

                         BEGINNING LOGO
          The familiar logo WARNER BROS. PRESENTS COMES UP.
          After a beat, it is consumed by FIRE.
          It becomes AN AMERICAN FLAG, BURNING in the street.

          1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1

          Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
          chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika! Fists in the
          air.

          SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
          YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.
          PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
          were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
          Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH -- JUSTICE
          FOR MURDER. A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
          bystanders than peacekeepers.
          A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
          An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.

          2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

          3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3

          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

          MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the
          window.

          4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4

          Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.
          We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA
          station chief here.

          5 INT. MARINE GUARD POST - MORNING 5

          From a pillbox on the embassy campus, SGT. ROCKY
          SICKMANN, a young MARINE, can also see the protestors
          break across the lawn.
