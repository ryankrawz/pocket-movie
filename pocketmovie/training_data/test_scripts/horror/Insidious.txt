          The universe is deathless;
          Is deathless because, having no finite self,
          it stays infinite.
          A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead
          of himself,
          By not confining himself to himself,
          sustains himself outside himself.

          INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
          white like the moon.
                         
          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
                         
          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
          ceiling. The bulb unlit.
                         
          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
                         
          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
                         
          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --a long hallway. Even darker than the bedroom. And without
          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          She stares at us.
                         
                          WOMAN
           Let me in.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          OPENING TITLES play out to the shrill screams of George
          Crumb's `Black Angels I: Night Of The Electric Insects'.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eyes flick open.
                         
          A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
          bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
                         
          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
          heaving snores have woken her up.
                         
          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
          but the lines of age are creeping in.
                         
          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
                         
          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
                         
          She climbs out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.
                         
          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
                         
          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
                         
          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
                         
          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
                         
          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
                         
          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Mom?
                         
          She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her
          son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy
          we saw in the opening scene.)
           4.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           What are you doing up, kiddo?
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't like my room.
                         
                          RENAI
           You'll get used to it. It's only
           your first night.
                         
          He climbs into her lap. She bites on his ear playfully.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Argh, I'm going to eat you.
                         
                          DALTON
           What are you looking at?
                         
                          RENAI
           Just some photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           What photos?
                         
          She hefts another album from the box, prying it open. A photo
          of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.
                         
                          RENAI
           Do you know who that is?
                         
                          DALTON
           No.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's me.
                         
                          DALTON
           It doesn't look like you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know. I'm so happy there. But
           it's me. When I was your age. I was
           a kid once too, you know.
                         
                          DALTON
           No, you weren't.
                         
          Renai bursts out laughing. She is famous for her big laugh.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't
           remember being this person at all.
           I hope she smiled like that all the
           time, whoever she was.
           5.
