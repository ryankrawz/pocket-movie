    BLACK

    We hear, very clearly, the sound of light wind.


1   EXT. TOWN - MAIN ST. - LATE AFTERNOON                        1

    We come up on... a streetlight. There is no illumination...
    and no movement. We hold on it for a long moment when
    suddenly... The streetlight bobs... and then begins to sway.
    We slowly begin to rise up on the streetlight to reveal... a
    small bird has landed on it. We continue to rise to reveal,
    behind the bird...

    Wind blows through the   gargantuan evergreens that seem to
    engulf the narrow main   street of a small town in upstate New
    York. Shop windows and   cars on either side covered in dust,
    the place seems frozen   in time. There is no movement.

    In the very middle of the road one can see... sand. A bizarre
    incongruity, a long pathway about a shovels width runs the
    full length of the street with offshoots into open doorways
    of some of the shops.

    We hold for a long moment:


2   INT. GENERAL STORE - FRONT - LATE AFTERNOON                  2

    Slowly pushing through the doorway of a large general store,
    also covered in dust. To the left, a cash register with small
    shelves of nearly empty candy boxes below. To the right, a
    towering shelf full of bags of potato chips, nacho chips and
    pretzels... None are missing.


3   INT. GENERAL STORE AISLES - LATE AFTERNOON                   3

    WE MOVE SLOWLY across the floor, down the middle of a general
    store. Amid the towering shelves of goods on either side, one
    may recognize a barely perceptible pattern of which shelves
    are bare and which are not. There is no movement. No sound.

    Suddenly... TINY FEET JUMP INTO OUR MOVING FRAME! Then, as
    fast as they appeared... They're gone.

    WE NOW MOVE UP the side of the store, looking down one
    aisle... and the next. As we arrive at the next aisle we
    catch a glimpse of... A SMALL DARK FIGURE!!! And then its
    gone.

    WE CONTINUE along the side of the store until we arrive at
    the last aisle. At the far end of the store we see...
                                                                2.


    a counter. With a window.     And shelves.   Suddenly... A WOMAN
    APPEARS IN THE WINDOW!

    WE GO CLOSE ON THE WOMAN as she scans the shelves, slowly
    lowering herself to the ground until behind her we see... an
    8 year old boy sitting slumped against the wall... HE IS
    BAREFOOT. On closer inspection we see sweat on the boy's
    brow, his skin pale from fever. The woman's knee touches down
    on the ground next to the boy as... she sees what she's been
    looking for. She reaches out her hand.

    WE GO CLOSE ON HER HAND as it reaches toward a shelf... of
    orange prescription drug bottles. Her hand suddenly begins to
    shift certain bottles ever so slightly... AT A BIZARRELY SLOW
    PACE... she does not make a sound. As she does this, we get
    our first glimpse... of names. Names of drugs. Names... of
    people.

    HER HAND finally arrives at the very back of the shelf as she
    gently twists a bottle that reads... AMOXICILLIN.

    ON THE MOTHER... as she inhales slowly? And then, as if
    doing surgery, she slowly closes her hand around the bottle
    and GENTLY begins to move it through the shelf toward her.
    Her hand, once again moves incredibly slowly, her now wider
    closed hand shifts even more bottles as it passes. JUST as
    she gets to the end of the shelf a bottle shifts... with a
    RATTLE of pills. This is the first, deliberate sound we've
    heard. The mother... FREEZES!!!!

    WE RACK FOCUS to the boy on the ground, who now looks up...
    with panic. The mother's eyes look all around the room...
    The way one does when they are waiting for something...
    LISTENING for something. After a long moment... she pulls
    the bottle in her hand the final few inches... and off the
    shelf.

    The mother draws a huge breath of relief. As she stands up,
    we reveal, just over the counter... TWO EYES LOOKING UP AT
    HER!!!
