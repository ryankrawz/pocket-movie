FINAL DESTINATION




"FINAL DESTINATION"   

Originally Called "FLIGHT 180"

By James Wong and Glen Morgan



January 15, 1999



Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.
Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable
inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
A CRACK OF THUNDER!

                                                CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED

An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

AN OLD TABLE FAN

swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

THE BED

A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

THE TABLE FAN

turns, head swiveling away from the bed.

TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.
As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN

There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

                        BARBARA
            Alex...

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

                        BARABRA (Cont'd)
            Tod and George's dad just called,
            he's picking you up at 10 in the 
		morning. Bus leaves the high school 
		for JFK at noon.

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.


                        KEN
            My suitcase workin' out for ya?

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

                       ALEX
            Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
            that on. It's like... the tag
            made the last flight without
            crashin' or anything, right?
            So, it should stay on, or with,
            the bag for good luck.

                        BARBARA
            Where would you get a nutball
            idea like that?
