          FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT (PASADENA, CA) - EVENING 1 
                         
           Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN
           well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
                         
                         
           A PAIR OF FEET
                         
           WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
           feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.
                         
           PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY 
           (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... 
           if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.:
           white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
                         
           Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.
                         
                          CAL
           Well, I'm full. You were right,
           hon. I shouldn't have eaten all
           that bread.
                          (THEN)
           Want to just share a dessert?
                         
           Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
                         
                          CAL
           You okay, babe? You seem out of
           it.
                         
                          TRACY
           Yeah, I'm just thinking about what
           I want.
                         
                          CAL
           Me too. Okay, let's say it at the
           same time. One. Two. Three...
                          TRACY CAL
           I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          2 INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE (PASADENA) - SAME EVENING 2 
                         
           JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,
           wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's
           going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.
                         
                         
                         
                          (CONTINUED)
           2.
                         2 CONTINUED: 2
                          JESSICA
           I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna 
           getcha!
                         
           She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with 
           delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the
           nearby console. Jessica picks it up: 
                         
                         
           ON SMASHED PHOTO
                         
           Cal and Tracy. This is their house.
                         
                         
           BACK TO SCENE
                          
                          JESSICA
           It's okay, my fault.
                          (THEN)
           Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,
           let's get you to bed before your
           parents get home. Don't give me
           the puppy eyes, you little maniac.
           Go brush your teeth!
                         
           Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica
           looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately. 
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          3 INT. BAR 3
                         
           Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh
           at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed. 
                          HANNAH
           I don't care. I love him and
           given the opportunity, I'd have
           his babies.
                         
           Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.
                         
                          LIZ
           Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd
           do Conan O'Brien? 
                          
                          HANNAH
           I'm just saying, Richard's a lot 
           of things: successful, smart...
                         
                          LIZ
           Boring, workaholic, sexually 
           repressed...
