          SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
          open.
                         
          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the superintendent and the
                          NEIGHBOR)
           Wait Outside please.
                         
          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
          onlookers back out through the door.
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER
           (to the superintendent, pointing to
           a pile of mail)
           What's the date of the last letter?
                         
                          SUPERINTENDENT
                          (VERIFYING)
           The 16th from what I can see...
           Wait...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the fire officer)
           Can you try?
                         
          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
          where he also opens up the windows...
                         
           FIREMAN (O.S.)
           The door is open.
                         
          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the
          police officer and the janitor.
           2.
                         
                         
                          JANITOR
           ...no as far as I know. During the
           whole time, they had a nurse, but
           it's been a while since I last saw
           her. My wife has been...
                         
          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
          curtains billow into the room.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
           (to the firemen who are now curious
           enough to come and stand by the
                          DOOR)
           Did you open the windows?
                         
          The firemen shake their heads.
                         
          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
          crucifix.
